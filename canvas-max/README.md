## Tools

### Color picker

There are 8 options, 5 main colors, one eraser tool, a random tool, and a custom color picker. Click the R button for random options. Click the E button for the eraser tool. Each tool will be outlined in black if they are picked.

### Size picker

There is a slider next to the color picker. By default the max is 100px and min is 1, but the max can be changed for a bigger brush or a more precise selection of brushes. The interval can be changed in the settings. By default it is 1.

### Preview window

There is a small window that shows the current color and size of the brush. It is updated in real-time. It will give you a preview sample of the brush, up to 100px in width. It displays data in a line.

### Coordinates

There is a small window that shows the current coordinates of the mouse. It is updated in real-time. It will give you the current position of the mouse in the canvas. It will show the x and y coordinates and will be helpful in future updates when tools become a thing.

### Clear all

There is a button that clears the canvas. It is located in the top right corner of the canvas. It will clear the canvas and reset the color and size to the default settings.

### Settings

There is a button that opens the settings modal. It is located in the top right corner of the canvas. It will open the settings modal. It is currently under construction.

### Help

There is a button that opens the help modal. It is located in the top right corner of the canvas. It will open the help modal. It will give you a brief overview of the functions and operations of the app.

### "No tool"

No tool is essentially the pen tool, where no special tool is used.

### Rectangle Tool

The rectangle tool is used for creating a simple 4 sided polygon. The stroke style uses the stroke style of the pen (color will be red if your pen color is set to red.) To operate:

- Click on the canvas the first point
- Click on the second point of the rectangle on the canvas

### Line Tool

The line tool is used for creating direct straight lines. Click on two points to create a line segment in between.

### Circle Tool

The circle tool will be added in the future, but for now it will be a disabled feature as we cannot create a stable version of the circle tool.

### Text Tool

The text tool will create the piece of text inserted into the input area. The text can then be pasted across the canvas by clicking on the canvas.

#### Changing Font

The font can be changed by using the dropdowns next to the input area.

***A closer look at all of the functions can be found in the help tab.***
