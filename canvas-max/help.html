<h2>General Functions</h2>
<h3>Color picker</h3>
<p>
    There are 8 options, 5 main colors, one eraser tool, a random tool, and
    a custom color picker. Click the R button for random options. Click the
    E button for the eraser tool. Each tool will be outlined in black if
    they are picked.
</p>
<h3>Size picker</h3>
<p>
    There is a slider next to the color picker. By default the max is 100px
    and min is 1, but the max can be changed for a bigger brush or a more
    precise selection of brushes. The interval can be changed in the
    settings. By default it is 1.
</p>
<h3>Preview window</h3>
<p>
    There is a small window that shows the current color and size of the
    brush. It is updated in real time. It will give you a preview sample of
    the brush, up to 100px in width. It displays data in a line.
</p>
<h3>Coordinates</h3>
<p>
    There is a small window that shows the current coordinates of the mouse.
    It is updated in real time. It will give you the current position of the
    mouse in the canvas. It will show the x and y coordinates and will be
    helpful in future updates when tools become a thing.
</p>
<h2>General Operations</h2>
<h3>Clear All</h3>
<p>
    There is a button that clears the canvas. It is located in the top right
    corner of the canvas. It will clear the canvas and reset the color and
    size to the default settings.
</p>
<h3>Settings</h3>
<p>
    There is a button that opens the settings modal. It is located in the
    top right corner of the canvas. It will open the settings modal. It is
    currently under construction.
</p>
<h3>Help</h3>
<p>
    There is a button that opens the help modal. It is located in the top
    right corner of the canvas. It will open the help modal. It will give
    you a brief overview of the functions and operations of the app.
</p>
<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>
    To draw, use the cursor and drag. Use the toolbar to customize your
    brush. On touchscreen, drag your fingers across the screen. To use the
    coordinates finder on touchscreens, tap the screen. Styluses work
    similarly to touchscreen.
</p>
<h3>Resizing mechanics</h3>
<p>
    When resizing the browser, most of your work will be preserved. Any data
    that appears outside of the newly resized window will disappear,
    however. This is because our programs make a copy of your original work
    onto a new canvas and attempt to repaint it. This data is not stored.
</p>
<h3>"No tool"</h3>
<p>No tool is essentially the pen tool, where no special tool is used.</p>
<h3>Rectangle Tool</h3>
<p>The rectangle tool is used for creating a simple 4 sided polygon. The stroke style uses the stroke style of
    the pen (color will be red if your pen color is set to red.) To operate:
<ol>
    <li>Click on the canvas the first point</li>
    <li>Click on the second point of the rectangle on the canvas</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h3>Line Tool</h3>
<p>The line tool is used for creating direct straight lines. Click on two points to create a line segment in between.
</p>
<h3>Circle Tool</h3>
<p>The circle tool will be added in the future, but for now it will be a disabled feature.</p>
<h3>Text Tool</h3>
<p>The text tool will create the piece of text inserted into the input area. The text can then be pasted across
    the canvas by clicking on the canvas.</p>
<h4>Changing Font</h4>
<p>The font can be changed by using the dropdowns next to the input area. The setting modal offers more options such as
    mega sized text.</p>
<h3>Downloading</h3>
You can download the canvas in the "settings" page as a .jpg file. The name of the file can be changed in the input area.
