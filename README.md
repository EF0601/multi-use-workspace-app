### Do you use any libraries?

No, but Node.js is installed as a runtime.

### How can I access it?

Use the Netlify Page link -> [https://reso...2.netlify.app/](https://resonant-douhua-6fea82.netlify.app/)

OR

For internet-less access or anything else, save the version by downloading the .zip file.

### Recent information regarding the app format

Due to budget concerns, we cannot source a code-signing certificate for the project.
However, the app has been compiled through electron and there are available downloads for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
Modern malware blockers will most likely block the app from opening due to the lack of a code-sign. You have three options:

1. Going around malware blockers and defense: according to your OS, there might be ways to "open application anyway."

2. Init the app yourself: you can use electron forge yourself, as it is preinstalled into the repository. You have to, however, download the repository instead of the app itself. Then, use your terminal/command line and run `npm run start` and if you have completed the command in the proper directory, the file, the app should automatically start. Once you are done, `ctrl + c` will quit the application for mac, or simply quit the application using the UI.

3. Use the web version, which does not have a different functionality. To access it with ease it is recommended to use a bookmark. For Chrome, go to the top by the star and create a bookmark, or `cmd + d` or `ctrl + d`.

### Is there a documentation?

Yes, but it is not comprehensive. We plan on making another documentation.

### How often are the updates?

The project is usually updated on Sundays and large updates are made mostly once a month.
